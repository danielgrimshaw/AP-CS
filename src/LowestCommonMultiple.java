/*
Write a program of your choosing that uses
at least 3 of the following operators +, -,
*, /, %, --, ++, that prints the input variables,
calculates a value and prints that solution. Your
program needs to print each variable followed by 
a space and then the value of the variable. The 
program needs to use one output line per variable.
Then your program needs to use the values of the 
input variables to calculate the answer and then
prints the answer in the same format as the input data.
This is your opportunity to experiment, be creative and/or
develop a useful program. The program could be created to 
solve a current math or science problem, calculate your grade
in a class, calculate interest on the amount of money in a bank
account, or something else of your choosing.
